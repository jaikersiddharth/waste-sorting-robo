# waste-sorting-robo
waste sorting robot which segregates plastic,metal,glass using conductive and inductive proximity sensors with sorting mechanism aided by servo and dc motors
this code is writtten in view in which two arduino one with motorshield (it occupies all of arduino pins) is receiving sensor data from other arduino via i2c pins.
components used
arduino uno--2
inductive and capictive sensor
ir and ultrasonic sensor
servo motors
dc motor(central shaft) for conveyor belt action
motor shield
